## Playlist Generator
A series of Powershell scripts call [Songkick](https://songkick.com/) to get upcoming concerts, then the scripts update Spotify playlists for each city with the top tracks of artists performing soon. These scripts are run daily in an Azure Function.

## Website
The playlist config file is used to create a simple website (built using NextJs) to showcase all the playlists.

## Cover Art
