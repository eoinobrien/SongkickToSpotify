# Upcoming.city

----------

## Unfortunately, due to the Songkick API no longer supporting hobby applications, this project no longer works.

There are currently no plans to find a workaround to this issue

----------

A playlists of the top tracks of artists playing in a city in the coming period, update daily.

[See current list of Playlists](https://www.upcoming.city)

## Playlist Generator
A series of Powershell scripts call [Songkick](https://songkick.com/) to get upcoming concerts, then the scripts update Spotify playlists for each city with the top tracks of artists performing soon. These scripts are run daily in an Azure Function.

## Website
The playlist config file is used to create a simple website (built using NextJs) to showcase all the playlists.

## Cover Art
Playlist cover art is created by me using images from Unsplash.
